## About

This is a site for Berkeley High&apos;s testing schedule. The
goal is to help students plan their studying and work during
this stressful time of the year. The site is designed as a
calendar, with the current day highlighted in
yellow.

Exams are shown on each day. If an exam spans over multiple
days, it will be displayed on each of those days. You can
click on an exam to add it to your list of exams. Once you have selected exams, you can click the filter button to only show those exams.

IB exams have different papers for different days. Papers are
displayed as tags, and are denoted with a roman numeral (I, II, III, etc.).
